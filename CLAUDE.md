# Symmetria IDE

A custom IDE wrapper built on NeoVim, in the Symmetria ecosystem.

Currently in **Phase 0** (inception). No code yet — only design documents.

## Status at a glance

- **Framework:** PySide6 (Qt 6 + Python + QML), migrating to gpui/Rust long-term.
- **Core embed:** NeoVim via `--embed` + msgpack-RPC.
- **Constraints:** keyboard-first, Symmetria aesthetic, NeoVim motions preserved.
- **Phase 0 deliverable:** PySide6 window embedding NeoVim, with a native QML status bar hosting one `orchestrator.nvim` capsule.

## Where to look first

- `docs/vision.md` — what we're building and why
- `docs/identity.md` — naming, tagline, design principles
- `docs/architecture.md` — embedding model, extraction strategy
- `docs/tech-stack.md` — framework decision with reasoning
- `docs/phases.md` — the phased build plan
- `docs/references.md` — Zed, Warp, cmux, Neovide
- `docs/future.md` — long-horizon direction (own WM, gpui rewrite)

## Non-negotiables

1. **Keyboard-first** — no mouse-required interactions.
2. **Symmetria aesthetic** — minimal, calm, consistent with Shell & File Manager.
3. **NeoVim motions preserved** — navigation feel is sacred.
4. **Compose, don't reimplement** — orchestrate existing tools (NeoVim, Qt, Claude Code) rather than replace them.
